The failure to release these files on time adds another layer of controversy to an already charged political atmosphere.",

The Epstein scandal, with its far-reaching implications, has captivated the public's attention and raised questions about accountability and justice at the highest levels of power.

With the 2024 elections looming, every move by the Trump administration is scrutinized by both supporters and critics.
